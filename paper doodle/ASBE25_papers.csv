Through analysis of a sample of well-constrained white dwarf (WD) binaries with low-mass primaries (seven eclipsing double WDs, two non-eclipsing double WDs, one WD-brown dwarf), we estimate the CE energy efficiency αCE needed to unbind the hydrogen envelope. We use grids of He- and CO-core WD models to determine the masses and cooling ages that match each primary WD's radius and temperature. Assuming gravitational wave-driven orbital decay, we then calculate the associated ranges in post-CE orbital period. By mapping WD models to a grid of red giant progenitor stars, we determine the total envelope binding energies and possible orbital periods at the point CE evolution is initiated, thereby constraining αCE. Assuming He-core WDs with progenitors of 0.9-2.0 M⊙, we find αCE ~ 0.2-0.4 is consistent with each system we model. Significantly higher values of αCE are required for higher mass progenitors and for CO-core WDs, so these scenarios are deemed unlikely. Our values are mostly consistent with previous studies of post-CE WD binaries, and they suggest a nearly constant and low envelope ejection efficiency for CE events that produce He-core WDs.","2023-01-01","2025-07-07 18:50:23","2025-07-07 18:50:23","2025-07-07 18:50:23","3966-3984","","","518","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","Publisher: OUP ADS Bibcode: 2023MNRAS.518.3966S","","/Users/liekevanson/Zotero/storage/WCM5CNGY/Scherbak and Fuller - 2023 - White dwarf binaries suggest a common envelope efficiency α   13.pdf","","","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena; Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics; binaries: eclipsing; stars: evolution; white dwarfs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the hydrogen-core burning phase, their convective cores are the prime drivers of their evolution, but inferences of core masses are subject to unconstrained boundary mixing processes. Moreover, uncalibrated transport mechanisms can lead to strong envelope mixing and differential radial rotation. Ascertaining the efficiency of the transport mechanisms is challenging because of a lack of observational constraints. Here we deduce the convective core mass and robustly demonstrate non-rigid radial rotation in a supernova progenitor, the 12 .0−1.5+1.5 solar-mass hydrogen-burning star HD 192575, using asteroseismology, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry, high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia astrometry. We infer a convective core mass (Mcc=2 .9−0.8+0.5 solar masses), and find the core to be rotating between 1.4 and 6.3 times faster than the stellar envelope, depending on the location of the rotational shear layer. Our results deliver a robust inferred core mass of a massive star using asteroseismology from space-based photometry. HD 192575 is a unique anchor point for studying interior rotation and mixing processes, and thus also angular momentum transport mechanisms inside massive stars.","2023-08-01","2025-07-07 18:50:16","2025-07-07 18:50:16","2025-07-07 18:50:16","913-930","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","ADS Bibcode: 2023NatAs...7..913B","","/Users/liekevanson/Zotero/storage/VIZIAZFT/Burssens et al. - 2023 - A calibration point for stellar evolution from massive star asteroseismology.pdf","","","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The enigmatic, massive Wolf–Rayet binary HD 5980 A&B has been proposed to have formed through this channel. We investigate this claim by comparing its observed parameters with CHE models. Using MESA, we simulate grids of close massive binaries, then use a Bayesian approach to compare them with the stars' observed orbital period, masses, luminosities, and hydrogen surface abundances. The most probable models, given the observational data, have initial periods ∼3 days, widening to the present-day ∼20 days orbit as a result of mass loss—correspondingly, they have very high initial stellar masses (≳150 M ⊙). We explore variations in stellar-wind mass loss and internal mixing efficiency, and find that models assuming enhanced mass loss are greatly favored to explain HD 5980, while enhanced mixing is only slightly favored over our fiducial assumptions. Our most probable models slightly underpredict the hydrogen surface abundances. Regardless of its prior history, this system is a likely binary black hole progenitor. We model its further evolution under our fiducial and enhanced wind assumptions, finding that both stars produce black holes with masses ∼19–37 M ⊙. The projected final orbit is too wide to merge within a Hubble time through gravitational waves alone. However, the system is thought to be part of a 2+2 hierarchical multiple. We speculate that secular effects with the (possible) third and fourth companions may drive the system to promptly become a gravitational-wave source.","2024-05-01","2025-07-07 18:50:09","2025-07-07 18:50:09","2025-07-07 18:50:09","9","","","966","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","Publisher: IOP ADS Bibcode: 2024ApJ...966....9S","","/Users/liekevanson/Zotero/storage/SX796PCP/Sharpe et al. - 2024 - Investigating the Chemically Homogeneous Evolution Channel and Its Role in the Formation of the Enig.pdf","","","1611; Stellar mass black holes; Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena; Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics; 1599; 677; Gravitational wave sources; Stellar evolution; 1122; 154; 732; Binary stars; Massive stars; Nonstandard evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One proposal is the dynamical merger of two stars below the PI regime forming a star with a small core and an oversized envelope. We outline the main challenges this scenario faces to form one BH in the gap. In particular, the core needs to avoid growing during the merger, and the merger product needs to retain enough mass, including in the subsequent evolution, and at core collapse (CC). We explore this scenario with detailed stellar evolution calculations, starting with ad hoc initial conditions enforcing no core growth during the merger. We find that these massive merger products are likely to be helium-rich and spend most of their remaining lifetime within regions of instabilities in the Herzsprung-Russell diagram, such as luminous blue variable eruptions. An energetic estimate of the amount of mass loss neglecting the back reaction of the star suggests that the total amount of mass that can be removed at low metallicity is ≲1 M⊙. This is small enough that at CC our models are retaining sufficient mass to form BHs in the PI gap similar to the recent ones detected by LIGO/Virgo. However, mass loss at the time of merger, the resulting core structure, and the mass loss at CC still need to be quantified for these models to confirm the viability of this scenario.","2020-12-01","2025-07-07 18:50:01","2025-07-07 18:50:01","2025-07-07 18:50:01","L13","","","904","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","Publisher: IOP ADS Bibcode: 2020ApJ...904L..13R","","/Users/liekevanson/Zotero/storage/HE9RLJBG/Renzo et al. - 2020 - The Stellar Merger Scenario for Black Holes in the Pair-instability Gap.pdf","","","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena; Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics; 732; Massive stars; 162; 2157; 944; Black holes; Luminous blue variable stars; Stellar mergers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Before stars merge, they enter a contact phase. Here, we investigate which initial binary-star configurations lead to contact and classical common-envelope (CE) phases and assess the likelihood of a subsequent merger. To this end, we computed a grid of about 6000 detailed 1D binary evolution models with initial component masses of 0.5 − 20.0 M⊙ at solar metallicity. Both components were evolved, and rotation and tides were taken into account. We identified five mechanisms that lead to contact and mergers: runaway mass transfer, mass loss through the outer Lagrange point L2, expansion of the accretor, orbital decay because of tides, and non-conservative mass transfer. At least 40% of mass-transferring binaries with initial primary-star masses of 5 − 20 M⊙ evolve into a contact phase; > 12% and > 19% likely merge and evolve into a CE phase, respectively. Because of the non-conservative mass transfer in our models, classical CE evolution from late Case-B and Case-C binaries is only found for initial mass ratios qi < 0.15 − 0.35. For larger mass ratios, we find stable mass transfer. In early Case-B binaries, contact occurs for initial mass ratios qi < 0.15 − 0.35, while in Case-A mass transfer, this is the case for all qi in binaries with the initially closest orbits and qi < 0.35 for initially wider binaries. Our models predict that most Case-A binaries with mass ratios of q < 0.5 upon contact mainly get into contact because of runaway mass transfer and accretor expansion on a thermal timescale, with subsequent L2-overflow in more than half of the cases. Thus, these binaries likely merge quickly after establishing contact or remain in contact only for a thermal timescale. On the contrary, Case-A contact binaries with higher mass ratios form through accretor expansion on a nuclear timescale and can thus give rise to long-lived contact phases before a possible merger. Observationally, massive contact binaries are almost exclusively found with mass ratios q > 0.5, confirming our model expectations. Because of non-conservative mass transfer with mass transfer efficiencies of 15 − 65%, 5 − 25%, and 25 − 50% in Case-A, -B, and -C mass transfer, respectively (for primary-star masses above 3 M⊙), our contact, merger, and classical CE incidence rates are conservative lower limits. With more conservative mass transfer, these incidences would increase. Moreover, in most binaries, the non-accreted mass cannot be ejected, raising the question of the further evolution of such systems. The non-accreted mass may settle into circumstellar and circumbinary disks, but could also lead to further contact systems and mergers. Overall, contact binaries are a frequent and fascinating result of binary mass transfer of which the exact outcomes still remain to be understood and explored further.

We focus on the cases where the donor starts as a M He < 0.2M ⊙ helium WD and the accretor is a M WD > 0.6 M ⊙ WD. Using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we simultaneously evolve both WDs assuming conservative mass transfer and angular momentum loss from gravitational radiation. This self-consistent evolution yields important feedback of the properties of the donor on the mass-transfer rate, $\dot{M}$ , as well as the thermal evolution of the accreting WD. Consistent with earlier work, we find that the high $\dot{M}$ 's at early times forces an adiabatic evolution of the donor for P orb < 30 minutes so that its mass-radius relation depends primarily on its initial entropy. As the donor reaches M He ≈ 0.02-0.03 M ⊙ at P orb ≃ 30 minutes, it becomes fully convective and could lose entropy and expand much less than expected under further mass loss. However, we show that the lack of reliable opacities for the donor's surface inhibit a secure prediction for this possible cooling. Our calculations capture the core heating that occurs during the first ≈107 yr of accretion and continue the evolution into the phase of WD cooling that follows. When compared to existing data for accreting WDs, as seen by Cheng and collaborators for isolated WDs, we also find that the accreting WDs are not as cool as we would expect given the amount of time they have had to cool.","2021-12-01","2025-07-07 18:47:52","2025-07-07 18:47:52","2025-07-07 18:47:52","125","","","923","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NASA ADS","","Publisher: IOP ADS Bibcode: 2021ApJ...923..125W","","","","","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena; Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics; 1799; 254; 31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
